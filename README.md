## In this project, 

1. I used __speedtest-CLI__ (Linux software) to collect data about the internet velocity of my residence and used a scheduler with the Cron(Linux Software) to repeat the task periodically. 

2. Then I organized the output data to be ingested into  Redis.

3. From the dataset on Redis, I produce an interactive graph about my upload and download rate using the __Plotly__ (Python module). 
 

To see the dashboard access this address __"http://170.187.195.209:5000"__ in your web-browser.
